# Database

## Rules

- **RLS on every table** — no exceptions, including join and lookup tables.
- **Never modify an applied migration.** A schema change is always a new migration.
- Server-side auth uses `@supabase/ssr`; never the browser client on the server.
- The service-role key is server-only and never reaches the client bundle.
- Regenerate types after a schema change and commit them.

## Schema

| Table | Purpose | RLS policy summary |
|-------|---------|--------------------|
| | | |

## Migrations

| File | Date | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
